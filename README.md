# cmd-imitation
A primitive imitation of Microsoft's cmd.exe

## Notes:
(I developed this circa May 2020)  
At the time I was fascinated by terminal applications (yes I am aware how that sounds). I decided it would be a fun project to make one of my own that implemented similar commands to that of cmd.exe. Looking back on this project specifically, there are numerous improvements that I would make to it knowing what I know now.
